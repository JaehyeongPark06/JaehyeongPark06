👋 Hi! My name is Jaehyeong and I'm a high school student from Toronto.


I'm a very outgoing and curious person, who's passionate about full-stack challenges 🖥️, dogs 🐕, and football ⚽.

You can find me working on my latest projects 👨‍💻, teaching 👨‍🏫, running my non-profits 💰, or doing anything else I'm interested in.

Feel free to contact me through my socials. I'd love to talk! 💬
